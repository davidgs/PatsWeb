#### Controlling It

That is the important part, right? This is how we control Pat's pain, and it's more an art than a science. It can be a delicate balance to control his pain without just completely knocking him out. There are lots of knobs to turn.

The Opioids are effective but there are side effects. The most notable is constipation.

Tylenol is on this list. *He cannot take any other NSAIDs like Aspirin, Ibuprofen, or Aleve*

The Cannabis options are very effective, with fewer side effects. They do Make Pat sleepy, but that's sometimes a desirable side effect.

## Opioids

These are the big guns, but we have many options.

**Important Note:** Taking too much of the opioids can cause an overdose! Overdoses can be deadly!! In case of an accidental overdose of any Opioid, there is Narcan in the cabinet in the treatment room!! Please familiarize yourself with how to administer Narcan *before* you need it!! Here are instructions for [nasal administration](https://www.narcan.com/patients/how-to-use-narcan/) of Naloxone, or watch the [video](https://youtu.be/-xTKsHFBXlI) from the AMA. 

- Dilaudid (Hydromorphone 2mg)
  These are tiny, but powerful little devils.  Up to 2 every four hours when the pain is intense. Combine it with the Gummies or Rick Simpson Oil for maximum effect.

- Oxycodone / Acetaminophen (5mg/325mg)
  Slightly larger, but paradoxically less powerful. These are good once the pain is under control in order to keep it that way. Again, up to 2 every 4 hours, but don’t combine with the Dilaudid.

## Cannabis

Yes, weed. It's exceedingly good at controlling pain, as well as nausea. It's also very good as a sleep-aid.

- **Rick Simpson Oil (RSO)**
  If you’ve ever smelled weed, or used a bong, this will be a familiar smell. Don’t be fooled, this is powerful stuff! A little goes a long way!

  **Usage:** Drop the syringe in a glass of *hot* water for about 3-5 minutes, then push out a glob about 1/4 to 1/2 inch long. More for intense pain or when sleep is difficult.

  A chopstick works well to put it on.

  - **Sativa:** Use this for daytime. It doesn't deliver the knockout punch like the Indica does.
  - **Indica:** Use this at night. A big enough dollop and it's lights out!
- **Gummies**
  - **Sativa:** These are 'daytime' gummies. Good for nausea and pain when compined with one of the Opioids. Taking one of these as you begin the drive to Boca for Dr's appointments, Chemo, or radiation therapy is a good idea!

  - **Indica:** Nighttime Gummies help with sleep when the RSO is too powerful.
