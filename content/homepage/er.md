## They will want to know what he has:

- Stage IV esophageal cancer, metastasized to the lungs and the bones. (So he has lung cancer and bone cancer now too.)
- He has a history of severe blood clotting leading to clots in and around the heart.
- **Important: Allergies:**
  - He is allergic to penicillin.
  - He is allergic to shellfish.
  - He is allergic to nuts.
- He has bilateral pleural tubes for draining fluid from around his lungs. He gets one lung drained every day, alternating sides.
- Lock up the cute nurses because Patrick ü§£

Make sure they know what his [medications](dailies.md) are, as well as any [pain meds](meds.md) he has had.

Pat has a QRCode on the back of his phone that any nurse or Doctor can scan that will bring them to this site.

## Things they can, and cannot, do

During intake, the intake nurse will want to do certain things as ‚Äústandard procedure‚Äù. Here‚Äôs what they can, and cannot, do:

### Cannot Do
- No bloodpressure on the left or right arm: History of bloodclots in the arms leading into the heart. *NO EXCEPTIONS*.
- Bloodpressure *ONLY* on the left lower leg (the right leg is too painful).

### Can Do
- Oral temperature is fine
- Pulse-Ox is fine on any finger

### IVs and Bloodwork
Before they ask, it‚Äôs important to inform them that if they will want to start an IV, or take *any* blood samples, etc. they **must** get a nurse to access his port. His port is in his right femoral vein and is **not** easy to access.

No matter what any nurse says, etc. they are absolutely *NOT* allowed to attempt IVs or blood draws from anywhere other than the port!

Nurses will say "I can do this" but they cannot. Do not allow them to even try.

## Your job:
 Cock-block any and all attempts to violate any of these things. Be gentle, but firm. If gentle and firm doesn‚Äôt work, then be more aggressive. But stay firm. Do not yield on any of these points.
