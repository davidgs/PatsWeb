Pat takes several medications every day. There are morning meds, 3pm meds, and night-time meds.

Just put them in a white bowl, put them next to him, and remind him to take them. No need to make a fuss about them. That's all there is to it. Check back to make sure they are gone.

The boxes should be refilled every weekend.

In addition, he takes a Lovenox (100ml) injection every morning and every evening. His nurse, Shantal, will take care of the evening injection while his pleural tube is drained. In general, Wendy will handle his morning injections. If she is not available, [{{<icon class="fa fa-phone">}}&nbsp; call me](tel:19195345099) and I can walk you through it.
