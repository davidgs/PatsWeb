## The Announcement
If you were lucky enough to have Pat Hogan count you as a friend, you were indeed blessed. His generosity, love of life, ease of laughter, and warmth of love were his trademark. He made it a point to make every person he encountered feel loved and special.

The world is a slightly colder place today as Pat has left us. He died today at 10:30am with his closest friends at his side. He was surrounded by love. He will forever be missed and our hearts are broken. We will send more details about if, when, and where any celebration of life will be held as soon as we are able.

## The Obituary
Patrick Hogan, Son of Ursula, Brother, Captain Pat, Pat, Sponsor, Sponsee, Friend, Little Brother, Big Brother, set sail quietly on a fair wind and his own terms August 31, 2021 @ 10:00 Hours from his beautiful Fort Pierce, Florida retreat.

Born in Enfield, CT Patrick built his career traveling the world and embracing every adventure he encountered. Starting out in the tobacco fields of Enfield, he was a carpet cleaner, roofer, electrician, masseuse, yacht broker and deliverer, mate, and finally realizing his dream: Tugboat Captain. His last port of call was the Hudson River where he tended to the building of the new Tappan Zee Bridge.

Patrick was not only an active Friend of Bill and Bob’s since July of 1982, he was also of constant Service to them and their friends. Patrick knew being of Service made him a better person and the world a better place. You only needed to ask, “Hey Pat, would you, will you, can you?” and he was there. When a room was asked for a volunteer, Patrick’s was always one of the first hands to be raised. 

Patrick’s Big Brother, Peter Hryniewicz and his family were gifted to him when he was about seven years old.  A constant in Patrick’s life for more than 53 years, they helped the young boy become the person we all know and love.  As time went by Patrick too became a Big Brother himself. He was always grateful to give back some of what he received.  Patrick was a huge supporter of the Big Brothers Big Sisters in Rockland County, NY.  He made his sailboat available to the Big’s and Little’s with regular cruises on the Hudson.  He beamed whenever he talked about how much fun everyone had whether the sun shined or not.  One of his proudest achievements was being celebrated as one of the Honorees Who Help Us Help the Community of Rockland in 2019 for his service.  The award sits in a prominent place in his home.

Patrick was predeceased by his parents Ursula (Kendrtarvich) and Dick Hogan. He is survived by his biological big brother John and John’s Sweetheart, Jill of Westerly Rhode Island, and a wide network of extended family tied in his lasting embrace to a world filled with laughter and love.  All will celebrate his love and friendship in the tales and memories of adventures with Captain Pat.

Patrick was, and John remains, ever grateful to the endless village of dear friends and caregivers, including Wendy, his Lady friend next door, all the Freedman’s, the many friends who gave their hearts in care, including but NOT limited to, all the Friends of Bill and Bob, the remarkable and steady Nurse Shantel and her family, the doctors, PAs, Nurses, and administrators who cheered Patrick in his fight; the Call Center ladies who always responded helpfully, the International Organization of Masters, the AMAZING Local 25 staff, Mates & Pilots who never left him, all the dedicated COVID checkpoint staff, and the many, many others who helped us through this last year’s journey. You are ALL truly amazing!
 
Patrick’s memory may best be celebrated with a donation to your local General Service Office, or Big Brothers Big Sisters of Rockland County, NY. Live life fully.

## From me

I am ok. I really am. Pat was my friend, but he was more than that. He was my sponsor, he was my confidante, and I was his. He helped me through divorce and one of the lowest periods of my life. I got to return the favor years later and as I'd repeat back to him things he'd said to me he would always say "whoever told you that was an asshole" and we'd laugh.

If I missed his call he would always end his message with "tag, you're it!" We talked almost every single day for over 10 years. He was my friend when no one else would be, and when people told him NOT to be. Patrick never gave up on anyone. We like to say "let us love you until you can love yourself" but Pat did that personally for me. He did that with everyone he loved.

I just had a talk with Julie where I thanked her for her sacrifice over the past year which gave me the opportunity to spend so much time with Patrick. She sacrificed so much while I was down in Florida for months at a time. She made sure everything at home went smoothly, and made sure I felt loved and supported from afar. Pat loved her, and he told me all the time to thank her for what SHE was doing for him by allowing me the time to be with him.

I have the most amazing boss in Mary Thengvall who invariably said "Take whatever time you need. Take care of Patrick, take care of you, and work will still be here when you get back." She ran interference for me with work which allowed me to feel secure in doing what Pat needed: being there. Pat was in awe of how she, and Camunda, cared about me, and him.

Pat's brother John, and his wife Jill, took such good care to make sure that all of his appointments were scheduled, that everything, and I do mean everything, ran like clockwork for Pat so that he could focus on life. Their sacrifices were great, and their love was felt by all. That was another gift he cherished.

I used to think a great year was when I got to see Pat twice -- when we roomed together at Ivoryton and when he started inviting me to Nyack every year to sail with him on his anniversary.  Then he started coming for Thanksgiving and seeing him 3 times a year was awesome. Even if it was only for a few days each time, every day with Pat was a true gift. He was family to all of us.

I just got to spend over 3 MONTHS with him. Caring for him, loving him, laughing with him, crying with him, and grieving his own death with him. The depth of gratitude I have for that is immeasurable.

I learned to live each one of those moments, each one of those days, to the fullest. To live in THAT day, and enjoy THAT day. Truly living one day at a time with him. We celebrated his life every day, and I think we grieved his death every day as well. It’s still hard for me to truly absorb how Pat loved me, or why, or why he chose me, but I’m starting to accept that he DID chose me. I never doubted that he loved me.

I also got to gain a new family with Wendy Freedman and her family. Wendy, Pat and I spent the most awful year of our lives having So. Much. Fun. We cried together, but we also laughed so hard our sides hurt. We made Pat roll his eyes so hard we thought they would get stuck. And I saw Pat learn to give his entire heart to a woman he loved more deeply than I had ever seen him love. And without the love and care of Shantel, it wouldn't have been possible. You're family now too Shantel.

So many people over the last few days have told me that as soon as Pat decided he was done, he kept saying “I want David.” And that he kept waiting for me to walk through the door. It was the honor of a lifetime to be able to walk through that door and be there for him. To be there with him, holding his hand and telling him how very much he was loved, as he took that final journey.

There is a line in a song I kept hearing over the past week that says “I will open my heart, and the world will know you by the way I love” and that is Patrick. That is what Pat was teaching me to do all this time. That is what he wanted me to do. That is what I will do.

I wish I could thank all the people that loved and supported me throughout this past year with Pat. The calls, the texts, the words of encouragement and support, and every bit of grace and kindness you showed me was felt and appreciated. I love you all.

I am ok. I am ok because Pat taught me how to be ok.
