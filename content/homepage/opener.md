If you're here, you are either Pat Hogan, or you are caring for him.

This website is intended to be a resource for all of those who love him and care for him in order to make his life and ongoing care as simple and seamless as possible.

Please, in the interest of privacy, **do not** share this resource with anyone else. If you've been given this website it is because you will be directly caring for Patrick in some way. No one else should have access to this.

**Important**: Pat has allergies! There are Epi-Pens in the cabinet in the treatment room. Please familiarize yourself with how to use the EPI-Pen immediately. You can watch a [quick video](https://youtu.be/EN83hen4D-Y) here.

If you have additions, comments, etc. please feel free to [submit them](mailto:davidgs@davidgs.com) so that we can make this a living document.
