# So You're Going to the ER?

## Things they can, and cannot, do

During intake, the intake nurse will want to do certain things as “standard procedure”. Here’s what they can, and cannot, do:
### Cannot Do
- No bloodpressure on the left or right arm: History of bloodclots in the arms leading into the heart. NO EXCEPTIONS.
- Bloodpressure ONLY on the left lower leg (the right leg is too painful)

## Can Do
- Oral temperature is fine
- Pulse-Ox is fine on any finger

Before they ask, it’s important to inform them that if they will want to start an IV, or take any blood samples, etc. they **must** call the Phlebotomy department to access his port. His port is in his right femoral artery and is **not** easy to access.

No matter what any nurse says, etc. they are absolutely NOT allowed to attempt IVs or blood draws from anywhere other than the port!

## They will want to know what he has:

- Stage IV esophageal cancer, metastasized to the lungs and the bones. (So he has lung cancer and bone cancer now too.)
- He has a history of severe blood clotting leading to clots in and around the heart.
- He is allergic to penicillin.
- He is allergic to shellfish.
- He is allergic to nuts.
- Lock up the cute nurses.hugo new site 

## Your job:
 Cock-block any and all attempts to violate any of these things. Be gentle, but firm. If gentle and firm doesn’t work, then be more aggressive. But stay firm. Do not yield on any of these points.
