If you were lucky enough to have Pat Hogan count you as a friend, you were indeed blessed. His generosity, love of life, ease of laughter, and warmth of love were his trademark. He made it a point to make every person he encountered feel loved and special.

The world is a slightly colder place today as Pat has left us. He died today at 10:30am with his closest friends at his side. He was surrounded by love. He will forever be missed and our hearts are broken. We will send more details about if, when, and where any celebration of life will be held as soon as we are able.
